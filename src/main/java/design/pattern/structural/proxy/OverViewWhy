We need a standing or a placeholder for a real Object.
Or a placeholder object which can work in replace of another object.

=======================
Why do we need a Proxy?
=======================
Proxy acts behalf on an Object and is used for a lot of reasons some of the main reasons
are as follows:
1. Protection Proxy - Control access to original Object's operations
2. Remote Proxy     - Provides a local representation of a remote Object
3. Virtual Proxy    - Delays construction of original Object until absolutely necessary.

----------------------------------
Important Characteristics of Proxy
----------------------------------
Client is unaware of existence of proxy.
Proxy performs it's work transparently.
Thereby client does not need to call any method to work on the proxy.
