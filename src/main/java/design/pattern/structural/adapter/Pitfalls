Pitfall #1

Using a class adapter is a problem. Since using the target interface and adaptee 
to extend our adapter we can create a class adapter.
However it creates an object which exposes unrelated methods in parts of your code
polluting it.

Avoid class adapters

Pitfall #2

It is tempting to do a lot of things in our adapter. Since we  have access to 
the adaptee object which might include validation, modification etc which is not
at all warranted.

Hence huge recommendation not to do anything else besides interface translation.
