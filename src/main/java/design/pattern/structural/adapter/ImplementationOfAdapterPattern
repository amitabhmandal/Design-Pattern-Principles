Steps followed for Adapter Pattern

Implement an Adapter

We start by creating an Adapter Class
1. Adapter must implement the interface expected by client
2. Within the adapter class there are two ways.
	a) By extending from the adaptee class. We are going to simply forward the method
	to another method inherited from adaptee.
	
	b) By object adapter we are going to implement target interface and accept
	adaptee as constructor argument in adapter ie make use of composition.
