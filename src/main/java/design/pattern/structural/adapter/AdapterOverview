PRIMARY FUNCTION:
=================

The primary function of an Adapter is to produce a unified interface for a number of underlying and unrelated objects.

You will notice this pattern being utilised in many applications. For example, object-relational mapping) creates a 
unified interface as part of its API but the code underneath the interface is able to communicate with many 
different types of databases. Allowing the consumer of the API to not have to worry about specific database 
implementation details.

The principle structure of this pattern is:

Current | Future
----------------
B(C)    | B(A)

The B function cannot be changed and it is dependant on the interface that was originally provided by C, 
but now we are passing in A which has an incompatible interface.

An adapter can solve this by creating a new function A2C which contains the relevant logic for handling the
 interaction between B and A.

Current | Future
----------------
B(C)    | B(A2C(A))
