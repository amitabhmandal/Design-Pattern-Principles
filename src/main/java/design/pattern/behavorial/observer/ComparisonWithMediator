Comparison with Mediator

It only makes sense to do comparison if the design patterns are relatable.
If they are totally different then it does not make sense.
Hence it does not make sense to compare Observer with Memento.


Thereby similarities exist between mediator and observer design pattern
hence comparison is warranted.
