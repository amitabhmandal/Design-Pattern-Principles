Observer is a such a useful design pattern that comes in shipped with JDK.
__________
Example: 1
__________
java.util.Observer interface and java.util.Observable class 


__________
Example: 2
__________
Another commonly used example is various listeners in Java Servlet application.
We can create various listeners by implementing interfaces like
HttpSessionlistener and ServletRequestListener.

We can then register these listeners with ServletContext's addListener method.
These listeners are notified when certain events occur like creation of a request
or addition of a value to the session.

If the listener is registered then only notification will be send out. This is how
ServletContext listener is optimizing it's observer implementation so that it does not
notify all observers for each event that happens in the lifetime of the application.

Example: 3
__________
Within spring we can implement ApplicationListener interface.
It is part org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener interface.
