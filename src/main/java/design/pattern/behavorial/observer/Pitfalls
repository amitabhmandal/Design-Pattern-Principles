**********
Pitfall #1
**********
Every setter method triggering updates may be too much if we have a client 
setting properties after one another on our observable.

**********
Pitfall #2
**********
Also each update becomes expensive as no. of observers. increase and we have 
one or more slow observers in the list.

**********
Pitfall #3
**********
If observers start calling back the subject to identify what changed 
then this can add up to quite a bit of overhead.
