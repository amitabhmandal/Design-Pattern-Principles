We use interpreter design pattern when we want to solve a very specific type of problem

What is the problem statement?

We want to use interpreter design pattern when we want to process a simple 
language with rules or grammer.

For example: File Access requires use role and admin role.

It solves very simple statements and does not solve complex problems as represented
by natural processing.

Interpreter allows us to represent the rules of language or grammer in a datstructure
and then interpret the sentences that are written in that language.
