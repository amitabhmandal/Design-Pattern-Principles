What it is?

Whenever we want to avoid the coupling between the code which sends requests for some
functionality and the code which handles the request or provides functionality for that 
request then we should use chain of responsibility.


How it solves the problem:

Typically the code which wants some request handled calls the exact method on an object
to process it thus tight coupling

What Chain of responsibility does to solve in the case of above problem?
Chain of responsibility solves the problem by giving more than one oject to solve the problem


How it is implemented

We create objects which are chained together by one object knowing reference of object
which is next in line.
We give the request to the first object in chain, if it can't handle that it simply
the request down the chain.


Downside of the chain of Responsibility:

There is no gaurantee that the request will be handled. It might be cascaded from one 
object to another. In the end it might be a possibility that the request handler runs out 
of the chain and the request is never handled.
