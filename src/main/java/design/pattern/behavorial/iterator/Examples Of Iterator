The iterator present in Java collection classes are great example of iterator design pattern.

The concrete iterators are typically inner classes in each collection class implementing
java.util.iterator interface.

java.util.Scanner is also an example of Iterator pattern. This class supports InputStream as
well and allows to Iterate over a Stream.
