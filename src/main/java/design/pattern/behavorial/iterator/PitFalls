#1
Access to index during iteration is not readily available like we have in for loop.
This problem we can see when we access Java collection iterator interface then we dont 
get access to the index of the collection.

#2
Making modification to the collection while the interator is iterating over the 
aggregate object oftem makes the iterator invalid instance as it's state may not be valid.
