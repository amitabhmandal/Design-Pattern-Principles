Whenever we want to iterate or give sequential access to elements of aggergate object we can
use iterator design pattern.

Iterator needs to access to the internal data structure of of aggregator to provide it's
functionality. This usually means it is quite common to have iterator implemented as inner classes

Iterator allows the client code to check whether there is an element available to consume
and give next available element.

Iterators allows us to give sequential access, however we can also provide reverse
or bi-directional iterator depending on the underlying data structure.
