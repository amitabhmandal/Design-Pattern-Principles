Difference #1
Null Objects never transform into a real object or even provide an indirection to a real object


Proxies eventually will transform into a real object 

Difference #2
Null objects do not act on behalf of real object. Its job has to do nothing

In absence of real object proxies will provide matching behavior to real object.
