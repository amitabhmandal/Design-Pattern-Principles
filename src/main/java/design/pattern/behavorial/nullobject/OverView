What is Null Object Design Pattern

We use null value to represent an absence of an object.

It is also to represent that this particular reference does not point to any object.
=====================
What is A Null Object
=====================

Using null object design pattern we can provide an alternate representation to indicate 
the absence of an object.

Using this pattern we dont have to do null check on an object wherever we are expecting null.

Most important characteristic of null object is that it will do nothing or store nothing 
when an operation is called on it.

Typically in our conventional code if we find that an object reference is null then we don't 
do anything with that reference and exit from the code.

===============================================
Benefit of Using Null Object vs Null Reference
===============================================
Same thing is going to happen here with the null object.
The code that is going to use the null object would not have to consider a possibility that it
is going to use a null reference.


Because we are going to achieve the same thing using null object.

Null object seems like a proxy. As proxy stands in for a real object. Null object seems like
a proxy.
========================================
Difference between Null Object and Proxy
========================================
However a proxy at some point of time will transform into a real object and even in absence
of the real object will provide some behavior with some side effect. 
Null object does not transform into a real object. Null objects dont transform into real objects.

=================================
Best Use Case of how Null Objects
=================================

If someone is asking to provide a proper object and we cannot provide a proper object.
And we cannot provide a proper implementation or correct implementation then we can return
a null object and the class and the class or code has asked us to provide an object will work
flawlessly wihtout using NULL Checks.
