Class which is using the Null Object should not do anything special when working with this object

What do nothing means for an operation depends on the context of the application we are 
working with in different classes.
This is especially true where methods in null objects are expected to return values.

So for example the actual method is supposed to return int then the null object returning
0 will make it sense needs to be carefully looked at or returning 1 makes more sense.

If you find the need where your null object has to transform into a real object then you better 
use something like a state pattern with a null object as one of the states.

So we can have the behavior of normal object as one state and then the null object will be 
another implementation of another state object which will do nothing.

So whenever you see your null object is going to translate into a real object then don't use
null object pattern then use a state pattern wherein it has a null state.
