Step #1
We create a new class that represents our Null object by extending from our base
class or implementing from interface.

Step #2
In the null object implementation, for each method we will do nothing.
However doing nothing can mean different things in different implementations. 
Example: If a method in a null object returns something we then we can 
a) either return another null object a 
b) predefined value or 
c) null.

Step #3
Code which creates object from our implementation, will create and pass our null 
object in a specific situation.

So if we deciding on a criteria which sub class to instantiate, and we get a value for which 
there is no subclass we can create object of our null class and pass it to the calling object.
