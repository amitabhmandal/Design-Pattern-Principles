Implementation Details:

First we design an Interface Visitor which is going to have a method for each concrete class we
want to support.

The classes who want the functionalities provided by Visitor define "accept" method 
which accept a visitor.

These methods are defined using the visitor interface as parameter type so that we can 
pass any class implementing the visitor to these methods.
