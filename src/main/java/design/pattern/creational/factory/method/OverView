What is Factory Method?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Whenever we want to move the object creation logic which might be spread through out the 
application to a seperate class(encapsulate in a seperate class) we can use factory method!


It is similar to simple factory however it add something new to factory method pattern.

------------
FIRST REASON: It is better than simple factory
------------
Whenever we need to use this pattern we dont know in advance which class we may need
to instantiate beforehand 

-------------
SECOND REASON: It is better than simple factory
------------
allow new classes to the system and handle their creation without affecting client code.

------------------
How it is achieved:
------------------
Factory method achieves this by delegating the object creation functionality to the sub classes.
They do over-riding the factory method.
