ConsiderRation #1

The creator can be a concrete class and provide default implementation for the factory method.
In such cases you will create some default object in base creator

You can also use the simple factory way of accepting additional arguments to choose between
different object types.
Subclasses then can over-ride factory method to selectively create different objects from 
some criteria.

-----------------------
Design Consideration #1
-----------------------
Creator hierarchy in factory method pattern reflects the product hierarchy.We typically end

-----------------------
Design Consideration #2
-----------------------
Template design pattern often makes use of the factory methods.

Design Consideration #3
-----------------------
Another creational design pattern called abstract factory method design pattern makes use of 
factory method design pattern.
