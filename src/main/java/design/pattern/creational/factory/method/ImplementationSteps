We start by creating a class for our creator

Creator itself can be concrete if it can provide a default object or it can
be abstract

Implementations will override the method and return an object.


Remember: Factory method is simply a method that can be over-ridden in one 
of it's subclasses.


Creator does not have to be an abstract class. 
It can provide a default object if not other subclass can handle the
creation.

If it cannot provide the default object then our creator will provide
an abstract factory method, then our class itself will become abstract.

Implementations of our creator will over-ride the factory method and provide
an Object.
