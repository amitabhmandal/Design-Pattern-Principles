What it is?
&&&&&&&&&&&
The builder design pattern separates the construction of complex object from it's representations.
It uses the same construction process to create the same object.
However the processes can create different representations of the object

You really use the  builder pattern when you have lots of complexity in terms of parameters.

uses simple objects and a step by step approach to create the object
the builder class is independent of others.

PROBLEM STATEMENT #1 IT SOLVES
______________________________
When we have a complex process to construct to an object involving multiple steps,
then the builder pattern can help us.
=====================
Complexity Definition:
=====================
Complexity can be in terms of arguments that the constructor needs.
OR 
complexity can be in terms of steps needed to create the object.

PROBLEM STATEMENT #2 IT SOLVES
______________________________

In builder we remove the logic related to object construction from client code, and
abstract it in a seperate class so that the user of the object can easily create objects.
