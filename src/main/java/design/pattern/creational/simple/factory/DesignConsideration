**************
Implementation
**************
Simple factory can just be a method in our existing class.
Adding a seperate class however allows other parts of your code to use simple factory
more easily.


Simple factory does not need any state tracking hence typically so it's best to keep this as
a static method.


********************
Design Consideration
********************

Simple factory can use other design patterns to create objects. For example it can use builder
to construct objects.

In case you want to specialize your simple factory method in sub class, you need factory
method design pattern instead.
