When we have to create an Object that is Costly.

Costly can be measured in terms of 

1. performance or 
2. calculation 
3. Or can be measured in terms of which are not in our control.

So whenever we have an object such that whenever to create the object we use that single object
or existing object as our prototype.


Prototype allows us to make copies of existing object and save us from having to create objects
from scratch.
