Cohesion Principle:

What is it?
It is narrow focussed and does one thing well.

Then it is said to be highly cohesive.

Cohesive code is a code which is not taking too many responsibility.

If a code is cohesive it has to change less frequently.
Like things are kept together and unlike things are far from each other.

Hence high cohesion brings the cost of the things lower.
