Kiss Principle: Keep it simple and stupid.

One thing I fear most is complexity: Our urge to create complexity.

Complexity leads to code difficulty change.

What is simple?
Simplicity: Can be defined in the following terms
1. Simple keeps you focussed
2. Simple solves only real problem we know about. For the problem we dont know about
we should wait for it.
3. Simple fails less.
4. Simple is easier to understand.
