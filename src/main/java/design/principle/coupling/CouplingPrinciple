Coupling: Degree of connectivity among things


It also means what you depend on or what you need to do the talking.


Worst form of Coupling : Inheritance.

It increases coupling between things.

 
1. Try to see if you can remove coupling.

2. Can't remove all the dependencies. If we remove all the dependencies then the 
system shall become so stable that it will not be able to run.

Hence in order to maintain the functionality of the system we need to have some sort
of dependency.

1. Get rid of it.
2. Make it loose instead of tight.


Depending on a class is tight coupling. Depending on an interface is loose coupling.

Use caution: A good design has high cohesion and loose coupling.
