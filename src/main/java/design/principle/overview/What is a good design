What is a good design?

Design is good, Because I created it. (Funny .. haha).

Objective in defining a good design:

A design is good if the cost of changing the design is minimum.
Thus if a change requirements comes in then I am not going to spend too much time
and effort in changing it.


Problem with the Above definition:
In reality what happens when the change requirement comes in we look at the design
and we can figure it is horrible and safely assume that we messed up.


A very good way to test the design?
Thus to sum up a good design is something which is easier to change. Maybe we can
do one thing is subjecting the design to change and see how the design stands up.


Almost impossible to get it right at the first time.


SOFTWARE IS NEVER WRITTEN, IT IS ALWAYS RE-WRITTEN.
