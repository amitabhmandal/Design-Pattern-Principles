How to Create good Design

To create good design, first we need it to let it go of the ego.
We need the right amount of ego to feel pride and motivated through passion to get the job done.
It is basically like a cholestrol, all the good stuff we need and not the bad stuff.

Be unemotional. When we go off the emotional content then we are not attached to the 
solution but to the problem statement and thus come up with better design.
