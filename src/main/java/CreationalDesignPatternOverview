Creational Design Pattern:
**************************
It is involved in the process of creation of objects of classes.


==================================================
Why do we need a design Pattern to create Objects:
==================================================
Why we can't new operator to create objects.

Well the answer is quite simple. We have various technical requirements when we are doing a real
enterprise application development.

@@@@@@@@
REASON 1:
@@@@@@@@ 
Your object may need to create multiple other objects before it can be created

@@@@@@@@@
REASON 2:
@@@@@@@@@ 
There are multiple steps needed to create an object.
For example: 
We might need to some information from the file.
We might need to some information from the URL.

And after reading information from the file or URL we might be able to create our final object.

@@@@@@@@
REASON 3:
@@@@@@@@
Sometimes we might have a requirement of only instance of the object in the entire application
because that class might be representing a configuration. So it makes sense to have only one 
instance of the configuration class.


The creational Design Patterns are as follows:
1. Builder 
2. Simple Factory
3. Factory method
4. Prototype
5. Singleton
6. Abstract Factory
7. Object Pool
